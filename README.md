#Jargon Tron Readme
##Intro
JargonTron is a sports jargon generator that you can teach new phrases! 
<br>
<br>
Note: In order to prevent people from abusing this bot and placing objectionable content, it only accepts content from people it follows. If you want to add to the bot, please hit up @DoHimJob. 
##Format
JargonTron uses a MySQL database with three tables, Exclamation, Player, and Quip. It randomly selects an entry on each table to create a new garbage sports phrase, using this format: <font color = "red">Exclamation</font><font color = "blue">Player</font><font color = "orange">Quip</font>
<br>
<br>
Here are some example tweets I just generated: 
<br>
* <font color = "red">Wow. </font><font color = "blue">Derek Jeter </font><font color = "orange">just has no hustle.</font> <br>
* <font color = "red">Huh. </font><font color = "blue">Ty Cobb</font><font color = "orange"> can't dunk for shit.</font><br>
* <font color = "red">Holy Shit! </font><font color = "blue">Lionel Messi </font><font color = "orange">is a shitty garbage golem.</font>

You get the idea. 

##Adding Content
Want to add stuff to JargonTron? It's super easy! Just tweet: <br>

@JargonTron exclamation + GUH.<br>
@JargonTron player + Addie Joss <br>
@JargonTron quip + is a horrible turdlord. <br>

Jargon Tron will prune extra whitespace, though I recommend you end exclamations or quips with punctuation, and add no punctuation to players. 

Go Nuts!
